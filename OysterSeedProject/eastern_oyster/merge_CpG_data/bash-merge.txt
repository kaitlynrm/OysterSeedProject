####### SOLUTION #######

#!/bin/bash

## Script to append sample-specific headers to each ID_CpG

## file and join all ID_CpG files.


## Run file from within this directory.


# Temp file placeholder
tmp=$(mktemp)


# Create array of subdirectories.
array=(*/)


# Create column headers for ID_CpG files using sample name from directory name.


for file in ${array[@]}
do
  gene=$(echo ${file} | awk -F\[._] '{print $6"_"$7}')
  sed "1iID\t${gene}" ${file}ID_CpG > ${file}ID_CpG_labelled; 
done



# Create initial file for joining
cp ${array[0]}ID_CpG_labelled ID_CpG_labelled_all


# Loop through array and performs joins.


for file in ${array[@]:1}
do
  join \
  --nocheck-order \
  ID_CpG_labelled_all ${file}ID_CpG_labelled \
  | column -t \
  > ${tmp} \
  && mv ${tmp} ID_CpG_labelled_all
